# Hello

This is the repository for the highly popular website, [Silly Widgets](http://sillywidgets.com). Thanks for stopping by and looking with your eyes, or however you "see."

# Stuff

* Uses SillyWidgets, [the latest version](https://www.nuget.org/packages/sillywidgets/)
* Hot to the touch
* Really good at convincing people to take some action, i.e. marketing, which is nothing more than artificially filling an emotional void in someone's life. For example, is your life boring and dull? You need more adventure! Try SillyWidgets, and adventure will find you wherever you go. Or, being lonely isn't fun. We were meant to experience love and happiness, and if it's missing, well, you feel miserable. Kick that misery to the curb! Experience the infinite love and happiness of SillyWidgets, and NEVER feel alone again.
